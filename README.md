Copy the userSetup.py to your ../maya/20xx/scripts/ folder.
Copy the remaining sansPipe folder to your ../maya/20xx/plug-ins/ folder.


You should know that Sans Pipe overrides the Ctrl+Shift+S hotkey in order to take over the Save As function.  
This should reset if "Auto Load on Startup" is disabled.
